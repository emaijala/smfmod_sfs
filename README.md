A customization for SMF 2.0 or 2.1.

This has some setting compatibility with the original Stop Forum Spam as I was using it when I developed this.

This version includes logging, bulk checks and the ability to check non standard SMF verification fields.

This is in development as I develop its needs for SimpleDesk where I am primary using it.
